# lunchrecs

Easy lunch and dinner recomendations for Hack Reactor students.

Planned MVP functionality:
1. 'Shuffle' button to get a randomly generated place from database.
2. 'Next' button to get a new option instead.
3. 'Add' button to add a place to the database, hopefully with Yelp API.

Nice-to-have:
1. Tips and tricks/Commenting system
